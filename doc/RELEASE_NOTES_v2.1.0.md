# 🎵 HymnFlow v2.1.0 - Major Enhancement Release

**Release Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Release Type:** Feature Release  
**Download:** [hymnflow-v2.1.0-plugin.zip](https://github.com/ebena107/HymnFlow/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

## ✨ What's New

HymnFlow v2.1.0 brings three significant enhancements to the dock interface, making it more powerful for professional worship leaders and A/V operators. All features requested by **Michael Fasina** community feedback.

---

## 🎯 Major Features

### 1️⃣ **Text Outline Styling** (NEW)

Add crisp text outlines (strokes) for better readability over complex backgrounds.

**Features:**

- ✅ Toggle outline on/off with checkbox
- ✅ Customizable outline color picker
- ✅ Adjustable outline width (1-5px)
- ✅ Real-time preview
- ✅ Settings persist across sessions

**Why?** When displaying hymns over video, images, or live camera feeds, text outlines provide critical contrast for readability. Shadow and glow effects work well, but outlines give the sharpest, most professional appearance.

**How to Use:**

1. Open Styles section in dock
2. Check "Outline" checkbox
3. Select outline color with color picker
4. Adjust width with slider (1-5px recommended)
5. Settings apply immediately to overlay

**Technical:** Uses `-webkit-text-stroke` for broad browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

---

### 2️⃣ **Hymn Editing** (NEW)

Edit hymns directly in the dock to fix typos and make corrections without re-importing.

**Features:**

- ✅ Edit button in Hymns section (next to + Add, - Remove)
- ✅ Modal form with all hymn fields:
  - Hymn Number (optional metadata)
  - Title (required)
  - Author
  - Verses (textarea with blank-line separation)
  - Chorus (optional)
- ✅ Full validation (title and verses required)
- ✅ Preserves hymn ID (references maintained)
- ✅ Immediate UI refresh

**Why?** Typos happen. Previously, users had to:

- Delete and re-import (losing metadata)
- Manually edit localStorage JSON (error-prone)
- Live with the error

Now: One click → Edit → Save → Done!

**How to Use:**

1. Select hymn from list
2. Click "✏️ Edit" button
3. Make corrections in modal
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Hymn updates in list and preview

**Technical:** Modal form with client-side validation, updates hymn object while preserving ID.

---

### 3️⃣ **Service/Program Scheduling** (NEW)

Pre-organize hymns for services, programs, and events. Perfect for:

- Sunday morning/evening services
- Bible study sessions
- Special events (Easter, Christmas, weddings, funerals)
- Multi-language services

**Features:**

- ✅ Create named services ("Sunday Morning - Jan 5", "New Year Service", etc.)
- ✅ Add hymns to services in sequence
- ✅ Reorder hymns with up/down buttons
- ✅ Load service to display only those hymns
- ✅ Navigate through service hymns with Previous/Next verse buttons
- ✅ All services saved to localStorage
- ✅ Delete services anytime

**Workflow:**

```text
1. Click "+ New" in Services section
2. Enter service name (e.g., "Sunday Morning")
3. Click "+ Add Hymn" to add hymns in order
4. Reorder with ↑↓ buttons if needed
5. Click "Save Service"
6. Later: Click "Load" to activate service
7. Navigate through hymns normally
```

**Why?** Worship services follow planned hymn orders. Scheduling:

- Reduces search time during live service
- Prevents accidentally selecting wrong hymn
- Works offline with no internet
- Allows planning before service starts

**Technical:** Services stored as arrays of hymn IDs in localStorage (key: `hymnflow-services`). Reordering is instant, no re-importing needed.
