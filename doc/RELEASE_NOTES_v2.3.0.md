The HymnFlow Dock now supports 9 different languages, allowing operators to work in their native tongue.

### 2️⃣ **CAC Hymn Collections** (NEW)

The first official high-quality hymn collections are now available for HymnFlow! We've converted the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) hymn books with manual quality verification.

- **Gospel Hymn Book (English)**: 1000 hymns.
- **Iwe Orin CAC (Yoruba)**: 997 hymns.
- **Improved Titles**: Robust title extraction logic ensures clean, preamble-free Yoruba titles.

### 3️⃣ **Optimized "Hymn Bundle" Architecture** (NEW)

To keep the core application small and fast, large hymn collections have been moved into an optional **Hymn Bundle**.

- ✅ **Reduced Size**: Core plugin download reduced from ~3MB to ~150KB.
- ✅ **Separate Management**: Update your hymn library without downloading the entire plugin.
- ✅ **Community Ready**: Easier to share and contribute new hymn books in JSON format.
