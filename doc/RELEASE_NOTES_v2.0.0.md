## 🏗️ Architecture

### Pure Client-Side Design

HymnFlow uses an innovative **localStorage + storage events** architecture:

```
OBS Custom Dock (Control) ←→ localStorage ←→ OBS Browser Source (Display)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No server installation or configuration
- ✅ No network dependencies
- ✅ Works with `file://` protocol (direct file access)
- ✅ Zero latency communication
- ✅ Simple deployment and updates
