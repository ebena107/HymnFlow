      "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found;\nWas blind, but now I see.",

      "Through many dangers, toils and snares,\nI have already come;\n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home.",

      "O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the worlds Thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed.",
      "When through the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.",
      "And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.",
      "When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim, 'My God, how great Thou art!'"
